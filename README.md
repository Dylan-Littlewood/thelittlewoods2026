## The Story
I have two main reasons for crating this website for my wedding.

The first is that I am having a wedding need to crate a website for guests to accept the RSVP and get some more information about both the wedding and us as a couple.

The second reason is, the website we are planning the wedding on (Hitched.com) is a fantastic resource and even offers a website creation and hosting service but for me, this service was too limiting with the design and theming options

## The Plan
For this website I plan to design this in Figma with my wife to be then transpose this on to this website to hose on firebase.
One main thing I want to do with this will be to tap into the Hitched.com API, even though it is not documented I will be trying to get the guest list from the site by scraping the guest page while logged into the site then for the RSVPs I will be calling the API with the information gathered about the guests to update the guest list on the Hitched website.
